## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm astrid, a passionate coder. I am used to Lua, I am a femboy, and I love bunnies!

## Why do I use lua?
it's easy, understandable, and well im used to it. (of course still have problems with it)

## How did I get into lua?
My brother needed help in Roblox Studio (i used to use Roblox Studio before), and I didn't know anything before it, and decided to use Jdoodle (https://www.jdoodle.com), Replit of course, and OneComplier (https://onecompiler.com), watching some tutorials to get used to it.
