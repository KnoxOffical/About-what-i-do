## About Me

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm @KnoxOffical, a passionate coder with a keen interest in robotics. My journey into the world of coding started in Scratch.mit.edu and Microsoft Makecode. Now, I'm excited to delve into the fascinating realm of robotics.

## Coding Hobby

Coding isn't just a hobby for me; it's a way to bring ideas to life. I enjoy infusing a touch of "Feminine Enchant" and "Rainbow Flair" into my coding projects. As a proud gay femboy, I believe in celebrating diversity and expressing my unique identity through my work. Working on my Javascript and Python Skills, I explore creative ways to blend functionality with a unique aesthetic.

## Robotics Enthusiast

Robotics has always intrigued me, and I'm on a mission to blend my coding skills with the physical world. Currently, I'm actively exploring areas like ROS interactions.

I believe in the power of diversity and inclusion, recognizing that unique perspectives contribute to stronger and more innovative solutions. In my coding and robotics journey, I bring my authentic self to the table, embracing the "Feminine Enchant" and "Rainbow Flair" that make my projects stand out.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of the coding projects and experiments I've been working on. If you share a similar passion for coding or robotics, I'd love to connect and collaborate!

In the symphony of coding, life, and love, I'm dancing to the rhythm of creativity with my incredible boyfriend Edwin. Together, we're crafting our own unique melodies and exploring the infinite possibilities of both code and the heart.

May your coding endeavors be filled with the same magic and harmony. Here's to a future of endless inspiration and innovation!
